# Flash Study

Originally made to study for my HL Chemistry exam. Using techniques like spaced-repetition and active-recall flashcards are the perfect way to study.

Made with ReactJS, Materials UI package, LocalStorageAPI. Backend funcitonality still in the works, hopeful to migrate to MongoDB or MySQL.
